## Introduction

The project clusters photographs of similar people together enabling user to find photos of a specific person from a group of photos. ü§≥ü§ñ

This year in [Foss Overflow 2022](https://fossoverflow.dev/), I get to worked on [Photo Sharing App](https://github.com/OpenLake/Photo-Sharing-App) project. It is a web app that allows a user to get group photos that include them without having to keep or sort through all of the photos, saving them time and storage space. When a photo is uploaded, the app identifies the faces in it and arranges them according to the users who have been identified. Each identified user gets a separate album with all their photos allowing them to get the photos they need seamlessly.


## Whoami?üë®‚Äçüíª

I am an pre final year student pursuing Data Science and AI at IIT Bhilai. It always interest me to work on challanging problem statements in the domain of AI/ML. I love to apply my skills on real life problems and luckily [FOSS Overflow](https://fossoverflow.dev/) gave me a chance to do so.ü§ò


## How was my experience with FOSSOverflow'22?üìà

I got an oppourtunity to explore and deep dive in the field of OpenSource. I discovered an efficient and improved approach to developing software. I got exposed me to many new topics, and it was fun to explore project completion ideas together. I'm thrilled I was able to contribute to a solution to a real-world problem.


## Why did I select Photo Sharing App as my project for FOSSOverflow'22?

I'm always researching different aspects of machine learning, so this project was perfectly up my alley. I've done some image processing in the past and wanted to sharpen my abilities. I appreciated applying new skills I had learned on a practical assignment. I now have a better grasp of development and the world of OpenSource as a result of this endeavour. I'd like to continue working on this project even after the event.üíª‚ú®


## What did I like about FOSSOverflow'22?

Given that FOSSOverflow'22 is a realistic simulation of GSoC, it provides important insight into the potential difficulties that might appear during the actual event. Writing your proposal, following your plan, and completing your duties on schedule are the first hurdles. In addition, my contacts with my mentor made me aware of fresh and improved concepts. Overall, it was a fantastic experience. Thank you, organizers and [Aneesh Tickoo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aneesh-tickoo-994145204/) for this wonderful experience.üéâ‚ú®


## Achievements during FOSSOverflow'22
Some of my achievements during the project:ü¶æ

1. Upgraded the UI for the user
2. Allowing users of a single room to upload their photos
3. Implementing three different models to detect faces in an image (Media Pipe, Yolov7)
4. Reducing the dimensionaly via UMAP to increase speed and efficieny
5. Clustering the embeddings via HDBSCAN with a minimum cluster size of 10
5. Finally, showing face albums in order of their similarities to each other
6. Developing a backend algorithm changing background of an image
7. Developing a backend algorithms to paint your image via a famous painter painting style

and much more...
