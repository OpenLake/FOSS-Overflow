## Introduction

The purpose of this application is to collect information of the app being used at any point of time for the user to be able to keep track their digital lifestyle. 
The information collected can have various applications ranging from making recommendations to the user for which apps to use or even what activities to perform with
respective applications based on the usage history and time-modelled predictions.

## Features brought to life

* This flutter app runs in the background and logs the application being used in every 1 second interval.
* The location of the phone is collected at an IP level and pushed to the server, with the help of the geolocator plugin.
* Created an endpoint in the NodeJS server API to push the collected data to.

## My Experience

Overall, I can say, the programme was an enriching experience. I can definitely say that I am better prepared to participate in GSoC than I was a month ago. 
Interactions with my mentor were the most important thing, acoording to me. He was very patient in explaining how things work, which helped us pinpoint the 
problem and solve them. My biggest takeaway is that I was exposed to the process in which my mentor works, while on a project.

## Technicals I Learnt

#### The app_usage plugin

In this project, the app_usage flutter plugin is used to obtain app usage data. However, this plugin works only on Android devices. For iOS, this data has to be extracted some other way, and using channels (flutter bridging), the data can be bridged to the flutter app.
To enable this, we had to build our own plugin centered around the app_usage plugin, in order to be able to develop for iOS in the future.
This part was possible only with my mentor, Kumar Shivendu, and I got to learn how to build my own plugin for my apps.

#### The Timer class

In my project, I used the timer class to implement functionality of collecting the required data at specified intervals of time and post it to the server.
However, the possibilities are beyond this and limitless. It can work as a stopwatch for games or be used in building visualisations that are pleasing to 
the eyes. It also runs in the background, so it can also be used to call a certain API at regular intervals, just to give an example, to update a parent 
about their child's safety. 

#### The Geolocator Pugin

This is a Flutter plugin which provides easy access to platform specific location services. It can be used to get the last known location, get the current 
location of the device get continuous location updates, check if location services are enabled on the device, calculate the distance (in meters) between two 
geocoordinates and calculate the bearing between two geocoordinates. 

## Vision

This is the first Open Source Software I have contributed to and proudly used. I am looking for the following features to be implemented :
* Build a frontend for mobile that calls the API to retrieve the usage-stats and present them in a meaningful and visually pleasing manner.
* Attempt to make recommendations on tasks to be performed based on the data collected
* Implement a feature where parents can monitor their child's activity from their dashboard.

All that being said, I would like to thank the organising team at OpenLake for conducting such an important programme.
