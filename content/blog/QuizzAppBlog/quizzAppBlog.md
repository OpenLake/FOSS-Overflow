## What is FOSS Overflow?

[**FOSS Overflow**](https://fossoverflow.dev/) is a month-long event celebrating open source culture and is organized by Google Developer Student Clubs and OpenLake at **IIT Bhilai**. The program is designed to prepare students for global open source internships like GSoC, LFX, and Outreachy. Foss Overflow gave me a great opportunity to learn something new while working on a project. It had a plethora of fascinating projects which were unique in their own way. But the project which attracted my attention was the **Quizz App**, as its tech stack was finely aligned to mine and it has also become a necessity in Online mode of study.

## About Quizz App

[Quizz App](https://github.com/OpenLake/quiz-app) is a open source project that let its users to make and give fun, interactive and informative quizzes. It helps its users to either gain some knowledge, test their intelligence or simply pass the time in interacting with others.

It is a web application made using *MERN* (**M**ongoDB , **E**xpress , **R**eact , **N**ode) stack and it also uses **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication. Material UI has been used for styling the web app.


## Work done in Quizz App

Quizz App basically gives three services, which are :

1. **Making A Quiz** : The user can make a quiz using an adequate interface by giving the question, its options , correct answer and time given to solve the question.

## Experience

**FOSS Overflow** has helped me in gaining a lot of knowledge about Web Development. By the means of this event, I have made any project by striving and searching on the internet and not by bluntly copying any YouTube tutorial.

While working on this project, I encountred some nasty errors and bugs which made me question my knowledge and persuaded me to work more hard. But still most of the errors were solved by [@Gopal](https://github.com/Gopal-Dahale) and [@KShivendu](https://github.com/KShivendu) who helped me a lot throughout this journey. I learned many things from them like debugging the errors, improving the code structure , time management etc. from them which has highly refined my skills.

At last FOSS Overflow is a great opportunity to get such a prestiguous platform and a supportive team of contributors and helpers, to showcase and hone your skills.
