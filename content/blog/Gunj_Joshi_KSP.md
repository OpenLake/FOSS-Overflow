## Hello :

You would have already known my name till now from the title. I am a student at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kottayam, Kerala, pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science...

Going boring, right ? Let's move to the star of the show, KSP !

## KSP !!!

As the name suggests, [Knowledge Sharing Portal](https://github.com/OpenLake/Knowledge-Sharing-Platform), or KSP is an all-in-one solution for students and proffessors to share notes, Previous year questions, study materials, etc. The platform also provides course reviews, which can be very useful for students to pick up courses.

And yes, the most importatnt thing, it is community driven ! You don't need to wait for your proffessor or your class in-charge to share resources, everyone can share and use them.

## Outcomes in KSP after FOSS Overflow 2023-24 :
- Fixed backend issues, which were obstructing contributors to set up the project locally.
- Migrated the entire database from Prisma to Firestore Database.
- Users of the platform are segregated into guest, user and admin.
- Guest is someone who hasn't logged-in yet, can only view the content.
- User is a normal user, one who can view as well as upload resources and reviews.
- Admin is the one who has the power to modify database structure, add courses, semesters, branches, subjects, instructors, resource types, etc.
- Used the AWS S3 Bucket to store files that can be uploaded and viewed by the users on the platform.

## My Experience :

With the guidance of some of the great mentors out there, I was able to conquer many challanges that I faced during the development of KSP. Since day one, I was highly enthusiastic to work on this project, because this was a kind of project that I too, once thought of developing. as a reult, I felt deeply connected with it, and kept on implementing the ideas that I gave in my proposal, in reality.
