## Overview

The Smart Insti App project aimed to revolutionize the way students and faculty members interact with institutional services and information. By consolidating various useful applications into a single platform, the app addressed the daily challenges faced by users. The features developed include:

- Time Table
- Classroom Vacancy
- Mess Menu
- Customizable User Profile
- Broadcasts
- Dedicated Lost and Found Section
- Common Chat Room

These features are fully functional with backend integration. The technology stack includes Flutter for the frontend, running on Dart, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. Additionally, the admin panel is hardcoded with features such as adding students, faculty, mess menus, courses, assigning roles, creating chat rooms, broadcasts, classrooms, and accepts input in the form of an Excel sheet.

The project, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenLake/Smart-Insti-App), has garnered significant traction, boasting 551 commits and 16 merged pull requests within a short span of 4 weeks. This remarkable progress is a testament to the collective effort and dedication of the highly talented team members: Aadarsh Verma, Arin Nigam, and myself.

## My Experience

Participating in the Smart Insti App project as part of the FOSS OVERFLOW program has been an invaluable experience. It marked a great start to my open source journey, providing me with the opportunity to collaborate with skilled individuals, contribute to a meaningful project, and enhance my technical skills. Working alongside my team members and mentors, I gained insights into software development best practices, effective collaboration, and project management.

I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of this program and contribute to the success of the Smart Insti App project. It has been a rewarding journey, and I look forward to applying the knowledge and skills gained to future endeavors.
