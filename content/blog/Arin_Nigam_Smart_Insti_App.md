# Project Idea üí°

Smart-Insti-App is an innovative mobile application designed to streamline and enhance the college experience for students. It serves as an all-in-one platform that integrates essential features, including a dynamic timetable,a room vacancy feature ,a chatroom for communication, a lost and found portal, and a dedicated section for important announcements. This comprehensive app aims to foster a sense of community, organization, and efficiency among college students and faculties.

# My Contributions üíª

- Developed the login by OTP functionality to the backend by writing API Rest endpoints.
- Developed Models and Resources both for the backend and frontend which were essential components for the app. 
- Created structured documentation and APIs for Student, Faculty and Admin.
- Implemented the User Profile feature.
- Implemented  the ChatRoom feature.

# What I gained üìà

Working in FOSS helped me in many ways including:

- Got more hands-on experience on Flutter, NodeJs and MongoDB ,which enhanced my full-stack developement skills.

- Worked on a project that involved an intense amount of code in backend and frontend. It was a good way start my journey with Open Source Developement.

- Working with my fellow teammates improved my Co-operational skills and learned how working together can help all of us grow and can also lead to a fast completion of tasks.


# Experience‚úåÔ∏è 
It was a great learning experience for me at the FOSS, I learned how to tackle problems day by day and how with great passion and enthusiasm we as a team can complete a project which looked impossible at the start. Thanks to all the mentors  Henil, Akshat, Aditya and Tushar and to the organising team of OpenLake. I enjoyed my time here, Last but not the least thanks to my fellow teammates Aadarsh and Sai who were equally great and passionate coders, I had a fun time bonding with them.
