## Introduction

Sampoorna is a one-in-all solution concept revolving around the women who fight one on one with various problems. With its features encapsulating solutions for the majority of the problems faced by modern-day women, it is a tool one step ahead of the existing tech-based solutions to the problems.

I got an opportunity to work on it during [Foss Overflow 2021](https://fossoverflow.dev/), which gave a platform to many other students like me to realise the power of contribution in open source and teamwork too. This was undoubtedly a very enriching experience and also a good kickstart to look forward to GSOC. 
This is my first Android Project and I learned Android during this program only. I am involved in implementing the period tracking feature which helps the user track the expected future date of her menstruation cycle. I will be more than delighted to continue contributing to Sampoorna in future to give it a perfect shape as proposed.

## Experience

---
In my initial days, I learned java as my first programming language. I was majorly active in problem-solving, competitive programming and building personal projects. This was my first meaningful collaboration in an open-source project. I applied for this program because Project Sampoorna caught my attention. I could relate to the concept, thus even though I didnâ€™t work on android before, I was ready to not only apply to work in it with some new ideas but also learn android from scratch to implement it all by myself. I had been contributing to open-source programs before but never really understood how impactful open source contribution can be. Most of them emphasized learning git separately or just merging PRs aimlessly in the name of OS contribution.
I was lucky enough to have an amazing duo of Mentors, [@Sunit](https://github.com/SunitRoy2703) Sir and [@Akshat](https://github.com/akshaaatt) Sir, who were always there to solve doubts. We used to be in constant touch over the official discord channel and their support never made me feel like I have been thrown at the dead-end which usually happens. In a month, I began from zero and currently, I am working on implementing notifications which feels super amazing. Through this program, I have gained enough confidence to continue contributing to open source programs and with android too!
On top of that, this was a paid program and some cool swags are also being given to all the selected participants! 



## Major Take-aways

1. Learnt about inbuilt android features-date picker.
2. Was able to get an idea of how UIs are built-Added Background Animations too.
3. Idea of notifications are added and how they work in the Background.
4. A stout foundation to prepare for Google Summer Of Code.
5. The Art of writing a "Clean Code"
6. Sense of pleasure to work on an idea that you correlate with.
7. Made a cool connection, [@Ashutosh ](https://github.com/yellowHatpro), my co-participant who also helped me with resources when I was stuck.
