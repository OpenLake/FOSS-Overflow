## About

In the vibrant world of open source, I recently embarked on a journey with FOSS Overflow, a month-long open source program hosted by Google Developer Student Clubs and OpenLake at IIT Bhilai.

I was selected as a mentee for the Student Database COSA project, working closely with mentors Aayush Krishnan and Bhuvnesh Sharma. This opportunity perfectly aligned with my tech stack and previous experiences.

## The Project

Student Database COSA acts as central student database that hosts serialized data of all the students with a captivating UI for retrieval and modifications. This project was about improving the website in terms of usability and security.

- [**Ticketing System**](https://github.com/OpenLake/Student_Database_COSA/pull/34): I implemented a feature where users can report and request changes in their student profiles while admins can conveniently view and review them.

- [**User Dashboard**](https://github.com/OpenLake/Student_Database_COSA/pull/33): Implement Personalized User Dashboard for each user displays the User's Student Details from the Database on the Home Page.

- [**Improving Security**](https://github.com/OpenLake/Student_Database_COSA/pull/34): Improving security using sanitization, validation, error handling and permission handling.
