# Introduction

Online-Judge is a small replication of platform like SPOJ. Where a piece of code is submitted against a pre existing question. The platform will run the submission against various test cases to decide whether the submission is accepted or not.

This year in [Foss Overflow 2021](https://fossoverflow.dev/), I have worked on [Online Judge](https://github.com/openlake/online-judge) project. It is a backend system to run and check submitted code
## Achivements

---

I achieved a lot of things during this project, some of them are:

1. Create a submit code API.
    * The API will take a piece of python code to run against a question.
2. Run submitted code in background
    * The code are submitted and run in the background. This frees up the API for further use.
3. Predefined Questions and Test
    * Currently, we have some predefined questions and tests. Against which a submission can be submitted
4. Code submission status API:
    * Any code submitted will be allotted some id. Status of a code any time can be checked. The status can be 
    Accepted, Wrong Answer, Run time error

and much more...

## Experience

---

I have been working on this project a lot since the start and I am happy with the results. We managed to achieve what we had hoped for the backend part.
It was a great experience for me. I met many new people and learned a lot through this project. I am glad to be a part of this project.
