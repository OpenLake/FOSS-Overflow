## Introduction

The main objective of the application is to facilate transaction within iit bhilai and among all institutes to pay 
off for small to duties or some beverages in canteen. Basically this app acts like a local E-wallet for the staffs
and students of that institute.

## Features brought to life

* The application can now invoke transaction for registered user and also register new users.
* User can see their history like to whom they have send the money or have received from.
* Users can customise their profile according to their liking and choice.

## My Experience

Okay so, Here is my story well starting off from day 1 of getting and starting my coding journey I was very much 
nervous and anxious as to what lies the path then I had a discussion with my fellow mentees of my project and we 
decided our share of work and got off to coding I only had a little intro to  flutter in the starting days and since 
we have to build everything off from scratch I put on my coding glasses and opened my editor.Initially it was quite ]
difficult to get accustomed to new techstacks and I did several mistake it seemed like a never ending tunnel for me 
but the mentors were so exceptionally helpful and kind I literally don't have words to describe especially my mentor
Riya mam she supported us and motivated us form day 1 and kept helping us till the last day. She really inspired me to
be a good mentor in future if opportunity calls for it.In conclusion I would like to say that I really a learnt a lot
and all these teachings are going to stick to me my whole life.Foss overflow really has very warm and welcoming community.
Thamk you for givig me an opportunity to learn.

## Vision

This is the first Open Source Software I have contributed to and proudly used. I am looking for the following features to be implemented :
* Create an API for order id on a server like node.js and call it inside razorpay to automatically capture payments from user
* Implement a feature by which user can see their pending transaction.
* Further improve the UI of the application.
