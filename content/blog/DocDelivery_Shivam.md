##Introduction

DocDelivery is an open-source project that provides users with a platform to track their packages and shipments with ease. Developed using Kotlin and its leveraging technologies such as Jetpack Compose, Dagger-Hilt, and Coroutines, the android application makes it simple for users to keep track of their deliveries.

I had the opportunity to work on DocDelivery during [Foss Overflow 2021](https://fossoverflow.dev/), which not only allowed me to contribute to open source but also taught me the importance of contribution to open source and teamwork too. This experience has been very enriching and has given me the motivation to look forward to GSOC. I am involved in implementing the offline mode feature for the users so that they can also sync their shipments automatically. I will be more than delighted to continue contributing to DocDelivery in the future to give it a perfect shape as proposed. 

##Experience

Before diving into this program, I had just been introduced to Jetpack Compose and was unfamiliar with its clean architectural principles and other fundamentals. In order to create my proposal, I made an effort to understand the codebase, which initially seemed foreign to me. However, I soon sought help from the internet and was able to grasp the concepts. This led to new ideas and features that I included in my proposal. Now that the coding period has begun, I have found that it is not as straightforward as I had anticipated. Implementing the feature requires careful consideration of potential edge cases that could cause issues with the logic.

But I was fortunate to have an amazing mentor, [@Priyank Sir](https://github.com/shankarpriyank), who was always available to assist me with my questions. We maintained regular communication through the official discord channel and his support ensured that I never felt stuck or at a dead-end. Through this program, I gained a significant amount of confidence in my ability to continue contributing to open-source programs and specifically with android development.

##Major Takeaways

1. Learned about content resolver API and how it is implemented with its provider class to query and manipulate data stored in other apps on the device.
2. Learned to code with coroutines, dagger-hilt as dependency injection, and other clean architectural methods.
3. Implemented complete offline mode synchronization for users to automatically sync their shipments.
4. A stout foundation to prepare for Google Summer Of Code.
5. The Art of writing a "Clean Code"
6. Realized the value of open-source community collaboration

Special thanks to my mentor [@Priyank Sir](https://github.com/shankarpriyank) who always helped me out with the project and I learn a lot from him and I also thank the whole Foss Overflow team for their support.
